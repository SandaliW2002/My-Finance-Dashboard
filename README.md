# My-Finance-Dashboard

🚀 Excited to share my latest Power BI Project – Personal Finance Dashboard!

I designed this interactive dashboard to track and analyze my income vs. expenses (2020–2024), providing a clear picture of spending patterns and financial habits. By simply selecting a year or month, I can instantly view:
📊 Total income and total expenses
📉 Monthly expense breakdowns
🔍 Top spending categories (where my money goes the most!)
📈 Expense percentage comparisons

This project was not only a great way to manage my personal finances, but also a chance to apply and enhance my data analysis & visualization skills.

🛠 Tech Stack & Skills Used

Power BI for building interactive dashboards

DAX for calculated measures and KPIs

Data Modeling to structure relationships across tables

ETL & Data Cleaning to prepare raw financial data

Visualization Design for clear and insightful storytelling

💡 Key Highlights:

Built slicers for dynamic filtering by year/month (2020–2024)

Visualized income vs. expense trends with line and bar charts

Added category-wise spending insights to identify top expenses

Created KPIs for expense percentages to track savings potential

This is my first interactive dashboard project and I’m looking forward to building more analytics projects combining statistics, computer science, and business insights.
